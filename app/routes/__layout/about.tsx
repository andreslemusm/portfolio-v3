          I went to the{" "}
          <a href="https://unal.edu.co/en.html">
            National University of Colombia
          </a>{" "}
          where I studied <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> with an emphasis in
          Networking (yes, I&apos;m a big fan of the internet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I didn&apos;t
          graduate and probably never will since I already learned the topics
          that would make a difference in my career (OOP, FP, data structures,
          and compilers). Also, today companies don&apos;t require you to have a
          degree, so it isn&apos;t worth investing time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After deciding to focus on learning everything related to front-end
          development (I used{" "}
          <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend">this roadmap</a> to track the
          topics I needed to learn), I spent almost 3 months learning everything
          from HTML up to ReactJS. Finally, I got my first job in May 2020 at{" "}
          <a href="https://fluidattacks.com/">Fluid Attacks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Like everyone, I had difficulties in my learning process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Something didn&apos;t click immediately.</li>
          <li>
            I forgot about something I supposedly learned a week before. üòï
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes it was just that the topic was too difficult to wrap my
            head around it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My advice if you&apos;re having the same difficulties is to take{" "}
          <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">
            this course
          </a>
          . It&apos;ll give you powerful tools to improve your learning ability,
          and the best thing, is freemium! ü•≥.

          I now work as a Frontend Tech Lead for the Ottomoto account at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.leangroup.com/solutions/leantech">Lean Tech</a>.
          I&apos;ve been developing websites from{" "}

          <a href="https://v2.ottomotoapp.com/">web applications</a> for more
          than 1 year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continue spending a lot of time learning new technologies, patterns,
          libraries, etc. And I&apos;m trying different ways to find a balance
          within that, my current hobbies (CrossFit, videogames, and movies) and
          the ones I&apos;m trying to build (traveling, cooking and writing).
